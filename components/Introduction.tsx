                    Standing at the intersection of imagination and technology, I create memorable web experiences. My approach is simple:
                    build innovative solutions that are both creative and functional.

                                As a design-savvy software engineer,  I collaborate with design-focused teams to craft websites and applications that
                                leave lasting impressions. With experience working in product teams and engineering efforts, I know just how to make an online
                                presence stand out from the crowd.

                                Whether it's a website, an app, or something completely out of the box, I believe that every line of code counts towards building
                                something that people will love to use.
